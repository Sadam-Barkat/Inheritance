# Inheritance in C++ (All Types)

This repository contains examples demonstrating different types of **Inheritance** in C++. It covers **Single Inheritance**, **Multilevel Inheritance**, **Multiple Inheritance**, **Hierarchical Inheritance**, and **Hybrid Inheritance** through practical examples.

## Overview

Inheritance is one of the key features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. This repository provides various examples for each type of inheritance, helping to understand how it works and how to implement it in real-world scenarios.

## Types of Inheritance Covered

1. **Single Inheritance**:
   - A class derives from only one base class.
   - Example: A `Car` class derived from a `Vehicle` class.

2. **Multilevel Inheritance**:
   - A class derives from another class, which is already derived from another class.
   - Example: A `SportsCar` class derived from the `Car` class, which in turn is derived from the `Vehicle` class.

3. **Multiple Inheritance**:
   - A class derives from more than one base class.
   - Example: A `SmartPhone` class derived from both a `Phone` and a `Camera` class.

4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**:
   - Multiple classes derive from a single base class.
   - Example: Both `Car` and `Truck` classes derived from a `Vehicle` class.

5. **Hybrid Inheritance**:
   - A combination of more than one type of inheritance, like single, multiple, or hierarchical inheritance.
   - Example: A `HybridVehicle` class derived from both `Car` and `Truck` classes, which are derived from the `Vehicle` class.
